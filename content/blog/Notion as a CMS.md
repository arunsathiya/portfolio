I just set up Notion as my CMS for the blog. I think there’s an excellent opportunity to use Notion as a full-fledged website management platform, integrated with a custom frontend like Astro. 

Notion offers website publishing capabilities, but I don’t want to feel tied to their design guidelines.

I put together some GitHub Action workflows to [handle all of the Notion-to-repository content building process, Astro build and Fastly deployment](https://github.com/arunsathiya/portfolio/tree/8af82b79914f0aa1b493c27527372041359e60bd/.github/workflows). 

Keen to test this setup for a few days, but I am hoping this becomes my permanent workflow.
