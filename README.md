I'm Arun, a full-stack engineer specializing in data analytics, serverless architectures, and DevOps practices. I work primarily with Golang, TypeScript, and Python to build data-driven applications and developer tools that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I'm a Product Support Engineer at Automattic, where I contribute to WordPress.com. My work focuses on helping users navigate complex technical challenges while building robust, scalable solutions.

I'm passionate about automation and productivity tools, regularly exploring emerging technologies like AI-assisted development, modern version control systems, and privacy-focused infrastructure. My recent interests include Claude Code integration, Jujutsu VCS workflows, and all things AI in the software domain. I publish open-source projects, and contribute to them, including CLI tools for GitHub API automation and workflow optimization.

My approach to technology is practical and security-conscious. I believe in hands-on experimentation, thorough evaluation of tools based on real performance metrics, and sharing knowledge through detailed technical writing. Whether I'm migrating to new development workflows, or exploring AI transcription models, I focus on solutions that provide measurable improvements to developer productivity and user experience.

I value authenticity, continuous learning, and the kind of deep work that comes from understanding both the technical details and the human impact of the software we build.
