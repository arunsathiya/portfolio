It was just yesterday when I was rambling about how Tumblr offers custom domain mapping for free while WordPress.com does not. I am a huge fan of WordPress for the open-source contributions it has done to the world.

Having used self-hosted WordPress sites for years, I am recently blown by how much has changed in the past few years on WordPress.com.

Automattic has shaped WordPress.com into a powerful medium since what I knew about WordPress.com a few years back.

Here are key reasons why I moved away from Tumblr to WordPress.com.

- Rich ecosystem. Interesting niche content that I can follow, subscribe to.
- Community forums. _I love volunteering as a customer support member. Look at my participation with Google Top Contributors program. Also, a SUMO member with Mozilla, Support Support member with Firefox._
- Having been with self-hosted WordPress sites for long, adopting WordPress.com is easy and WordPress.com's dashboard can serve as a single place for my new WordPress.com site and all other self-hosted WordPress sites I own.
- Clean mobile apps. Tumblr has one too, but I just don't feel content in the Tumblr environment.
  I am on the WordPress.com personal plan and it costs Rs 2400 per year. Decent enough. Not free as Tumblr though. But, helps connect with the right WordPress bloggers in the community.

Let me see how my experience with WordPress.com goes! If you have questions, ask on WordPress.com community forums and look out for my answer.
