I am a Day One user now!

The team joined Automattic this month. [The acquisition is perfect](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-at-automattic). Automattic is a pioneer in the web publishing and blogging space, while Day One champions the private journaling experience. I am excited to see what the future holds for Day One, and how Automattic integrates its products with it. Publishing from the app to a WordPress site, the other way around and Gutenberg on the app are few examples of great things that can happen.

## Day One on iPhone

Today on the company-wide townhall, the Day One team met the rest of Automattic. We had a quick overview of the Day One apps. They also offered a premium subscription for everyone working at Automattic. That's very cool!

I have not been into private journaling most of my life. I have written pieces on and off though. The first time I started private blogging, it was during my college days. I remember maintaining a notebook. That was my first time away from home/neighborhood and writing was a great way to cope with the change. I remember moving to a Dropbox later, where I stored them as text files, [encrypted](https://www.arun.blog/tags/encrypted-email/) with Cryptomator.

Day One, on the other hand, is a fully encrypted, cross-platform app. Android is an exception though. It does not support end-to-end encryption. I published a copy of this blog post as an entry as well. The Mac app seems polished with a great deal of features. I will not be using the Android app just yet. Hopefully an end-to-end encrypted version is available in the near future.

## Download the app

If you are looking forward to trying the app, they do offer a 7 day free trial of the premium subscription. [The premium version offers](https://dayoneapp.com/pricing/) unlimited media storage, sync, and backup, amidst a whole bunch of other features. Get it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dayoneapp.dayone) or [the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id1055511498).
