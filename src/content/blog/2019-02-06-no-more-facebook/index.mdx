"Your account is scheduled for permanent deletion"


I no longer have a Facebook account.


Every day, there are posts about how Facebook is violating user privacy and selling our data for their profit.

It's time to action a change. I managed to have my Facebook account deactivated for over an year, but I realized it's time to actually delete it and did so.


So is Instagram, WhatsApp and LinkedIn.
