When I attended my cousin's baby shower last week, I found myself reflecting on the things we most wish for a child as they enter the world. Amidst all the adorable gifts and excited chatter, there was an undercurrent of something deeper: our hopes for this new life.

As I filled out the "wishes for baby" card, I tried to get past the cliches and tap into what truly matters. More than any achievements or milestones, what I most wish for is simple (but not easy): a life full of love, joy, and the freedom to be oneself. So often we get caught up in specific visions of "success," but as I've grown older, I've come to believe that happiness and fulfillment can take many forms--as long as we have the courage to stay true to our own path.

When I look back at my own journey so far, the moments that stand out are the everyday joys. The belly laughs, the heartfelt conversations, the random adventures. I hope this baby gets to experience that same magic in the small moments. And I hope they always carry with them the security of knowing they are deeply loved, no matter what. Because in a world that can be challenging and confusing, having a "home base" of unconditional support makes all the difference.

Two of my cousins are expecting—so to the new little souls coming into this world, I say: welcome. Your arrival is a blessing and a reminder to all of us of what really matters. May your life be filled with wonder, may you define your own version of meaning and contentment, and may you always feel wrapped in the unshakeable embrace of family. We can't wait to see the unique mark you make on the world.
