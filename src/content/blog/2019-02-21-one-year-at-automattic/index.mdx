I cannot believe I have been here for one year already, time flies! While technically I started at Automattic only by April 2, 2018, I started on the Happiness Engineer trial process by Feb 21, 2018. That makes it one year at Automattic.

I am happy about what I have learned so far, achieved and I am thankful for the opportunity to be here.

It started with a team meetup (yes, my second week of being a full-time Happiness Engineer was at my team meetup in Singapore) and has come a long way to having the comfort of working from anywhere -- I have worked from home, visited relatives in various cities, friends, and traveled with colleagues to Vietnam for a localmatticians meetup.

One of the key reasons to why I am very happy with my job goes to the first line of the Automattic creed -- [I will never stop learning](https://automattic.com/creed/never-stop-learning/).

Being a Happiness Engineer has been rewarding with a lot lessons to learn every day. You get to chat to the millions of users, see what their problems are, see how you can address it and work with the product teams to prioritize them.

Outside of core work as well, there is a lot of time to invest in learning new skills, which the team, lead and the company is very supportive of.

Another reason why I am very comfortable at what I do goes back to the creed again -- [I will communicate as much as possible, because itâ€™s the oxygen of a distributed company](https://automattic.com/creed/communication-is-oxygen/). In the span of one year, I have sent over 35,000 Slack messages and have done numerous internal blog posts!

What's next for me? I have been learning to code and I hope I will be building my own Gutenberg block or WordPress plugin. ðŸ™‚
