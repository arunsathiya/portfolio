TIL that I can configure a global gitignore file that applies to all git projects, rather than having to configure ‘.DS_Store’ exclusion for each project manually. I came across [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1j8ed63/unknown_person_contribution_on_my_github_repo/) about an unknown user in a person’s GitHub project, which lead to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74052642) about a certain user ‘sainish’ having user ID 123456789 (that’s interesting), and about configuring a global gitignore:


```shell
echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```
