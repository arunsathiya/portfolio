I have written about [my DNS setup](https://blogarunsathiya.wordpress.com/2020/05/02/my-dns-setup/) in the past, but that setup is a bit outdated that I wanted to write a new post. I continue to use NextDNS as my primary DNS service. On the VPN side of things, I have switched from NordVPN to [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/).

I have stopped using Cloudflare Warp as well. It's not a VPN; they disclose IP to websites hosted on Cloudflare. They do claim it's not a VPN, and I appreciate that transparency.

### Android

On Android, I use NextDNS' DNS-over-TLS (DOT) address on Android's private DNS setting. That setting is available on Android 9 and above. Marking my private, secure, encrypted resolver as such ensures that it works even when I am connected to Mullvad.

I use Wireguard Android client to use Mullvad, as I have noticed Mullvad's official app to disconnect often.

### Mac

Since I switched from NordVPN ([they announced a Wireguard-based implementation as well!](https://support.nordvpn.com/General-info/1438624372/What-is-NordLynx.htm)) to Mullvad, I started using Mullvad's Wireguard implementation. It's as simple as downloading the Wireguard configuration file from their website, and adding it to the Wireguard client app.

Since I run NextDNS CLI, I setup that local resolver address `127.0.0.1` as my choice of DNS on the Wireguard config.

As an additional measure, I use `127.0.0.1` as my resolver on Mac's network settings as well. This ensures that NextDNS continues to be used when disconnected from Mullvad.

Taking this one step further, I have a Keyboard Maestro macro that periodically ensures that `127.0.0.1` is my Mac's DNS resolver. This is not a great way to implement DNS leak checks, but it works for me.

### Windows

Windows was an issue when I was using NordVPN. I could define NextDNS' IPv4 addresses, but that's not encrypted DNS. I wanted both encrypted DNS and VPN at the same time, which is when I learned about YogaDNS. [It's network interface-independent](http://yogadns.com/docs/interfaces/#problem) and works great with Mullvad. As usual, I use Wireguard Windows client for Mullvad.

### iOS

iOS is an issue at this time. I can either use NextDNS or Mullvad. The problem is, DNS implementation is done as VPN tunnels, and when NextDNS tunnel is active, Mullvad VPN cannot be. [This is changing with iOS 14](https://blogarunsathiya.wordpress.com/2020/06/26/encrypted-dns-on-ios/)!

### Pi-hole

I haven't shut down my Pi-hole yet. It's active and running, and serves all guests that connect to my home WiFi.
