I've been experimenting with HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) recently, and it's fascinating how a large video file can be broken down into smaller chunks for efficient streaming. The process involves converting a video into multiple quality levels and small segments, making it perfect for adaptive streaming based on network conditions.


The interesting part is how simple the implementation becomes with modern web components. Using `hls-video-element`, you can create a video player with just a few lines of code:


```html
<hls-video 
  controls
  src="https://example.com/videos/playlist.m3u8"
  crossorigin="use-credentials"
>
</hls-video>
```


While exploring this, I realized how this could be the foundation for a private media sharing platform. Combine HLS with Cloudflare R2 for storage, Cloudflare Access for authentication, Cloudflare Workers for HLS segment generation from the video file, and other scripting that might be needed, and you have all the pieces for a secure, private media pipeline.


The workflow would look something like this:

1. Upload media files to R2 storage
2. Convert videos to HLS format with multiple quality levels
3. Protect access using Cloudflare Access
4. Stream content through an authenticated HLS player

What makes this setup particularly interesting is the cost efficiency. R2's free egress means you're not paying for bandwidth when streaming videos, and Cloudflare Access provides enterprise-grade authentication without the enterprise price tag.


I plan to build this into a full-fledged platform for sharing photos and videos with family. The traditional solutions like Google Photos or SmugMug are great, but they don't offer control I'm looking for. And being that prefers having full autonomy and ownership of oneâ€™s content, hosting media myself on a personal blog is very tempting. With this setup, I'd have:

- Complete control over my media files
- Zero trust security model with Cloudflare Access
- Efficient streaming with HLS
- Cost-effective storage and delivery with R2

The next steps would be building the upload pipeline, automating the HLS conversion process, and creating a clean interface for browsing and viewing media. I'm particularly excited about using this for sharing 4K videos that traditionally eat up cloud storage quotas.
