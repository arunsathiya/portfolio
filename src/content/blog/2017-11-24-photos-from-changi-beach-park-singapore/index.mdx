I visited Singapore for the second time (first time with my parents) in between May and June of 2017. Here are some photos from my visit to the Changi beach park, which offered a scenery view of airplanes taking off and landing.

We went to Japan first, stayed there for 20 days and then visited Singapore for 10 days. This was my first time my dad traveled abroad.

[Changi beach park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Changi+Beach+Park/@1.3912863,103.9905464,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x31da3c0b63da3653:0xe8220a55468c725c!8m2!3d1.3912863!4d103.9905464!16zL20vMGZqYmM1?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) is accessible by bus.
