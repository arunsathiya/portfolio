I was reading a Hacker News piece about Amazon opting out of Google's FLoC and I learned something even more interesting. Google and Microsoft have been using information of WiFi networks, including residential properties, [for location tracking purposes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27516231). It's mind blowing that companies are able to make decisions as such. These requests must be opt-in, vs being an opt-out which is the case today.


Apparently this has been a thing for over a decade, and the earliest article that I could find on this is [this blog post from Google](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/greater-choice-for-wireless-access.html) where they outline a way to opt-out one's access points and routers from this location tracking service. It's fairly straightforward -- one has to append `_nomap` to their router SSID.


[As for Microsoft's equivalent of opting-out](https://superuser.com/a/1202168), one may add `_optout` to any part of the router's SSID.


To chain both opt-outs, `_optout_nomap` must do the trick. I did so on both bands on router - 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz.


This is generally done by accessing the web-based software for your WiFi router and somewhere on the settings menu, you will see an option to change its name.
