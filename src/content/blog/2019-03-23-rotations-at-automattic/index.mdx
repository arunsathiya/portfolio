April 2, 2019 marks [one year since I started](https://www.arun.blog/post/one-year-at-automattic/) "officially" at Automattic. The past twelve months have been a terrific journey -- speaking with thousands of WordPress.com users, seeing their challenges firsthand and working with developers on priotizing issues.


I can confidently say I love what I am doing here, but I figured I needed to experience other parts of support at Automattic as well.


Automattic has this process called rotations -- wherein, you can jump to another team doing similar work with a different product. I will be doing just that in Q2 of 2019; I am moving from WordPress.com support to WooCommerce support for three months.


Rotations are not limited to Happiness (support) division, but there are rotations within product teams as well.


There's also another process called _support rotations_, wherein new hires would start their first two-weeks in Happiness division. It does not matter where one's core work lies; whether one is a designer, developer, working in finance, or working in any role, one would be spending the first two-weeks answering customer queries on email and live chat.


I have experience in working with WordPress sites (both WordPress.org and WordPress.com) but I cannot say the same about WooCommerce.


I have known WooCommerce as a plugin to build e-commerce stores at the outset, but it does have a massive potential to do things beyond simple stores. I am looking forward to learning more of [WooCommerce extensions](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/), [WooCommerce apps](https://woocommerce.com/mobile/), and bring back these lessons to my home team.
