Automattic's CEO, Matt, spoke on distributed work and how we approach it.

[My first job was at Freshworks Inc](https://www.arun.blog/last-day-at-freshworks). and I jumped ship in approximately 8 months, in favour of remote/distributed work.

Primary reasons behind the change:

- I get to work from the comfort of my home.
- I choose my own work schedule. I initially chose to work from 10am to 6pm, but these days, I work from 5.30am to 1.30pm, leaving the rest of the day for personal chores.
- I am not really comfortable working/being around many people. A small group's fine, but when there are many around, I find it tough to focus on my work. Traditional office spaces are a no-go for me.
- I am more comfortable with written communication/documentation over in-life communication.
  One of my coworkers also wrote on "[Thriving as a remote worker](https://24ways.org/2018/thriving-as-a-remote-worker/)", which you should read.

There are tons of other benefits to distributed work - GitLab.com has put together an interesting [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) on how they manage their company, and a [website on remote work](https://www.remoteonly.org/) on how others approach it.
