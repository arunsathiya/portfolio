Last week at work, I learned that Slack has support for [one-click emoji reactions](https://slack.com/help/articles/360056881694-Manage-one-click-emoji-reactions-for-your-workspace-or-organization). It's a workspace-level feature which when enabled allows any member to configure their own top 3 emoji for quick access.

If your workspace has it enabled, you can configure your options under **Messages & media** tab on Slack settings.
