Choosing a brand new name for your personal website, or for your business can be challenging, especially when your favorite top-level domains (TLDs) are unavailable.

- .blog can help you change that.
- .blog is fairly new.
- .blog is eye-catching and easy to remember
  It's a fairly new namespace thatÂ allows everyone to be a publisher on the internet, with their favorite name.

> The word blog has expanded from being almost just like personal journals to really sort of indicating, a more interesting website. In a world where everyone is a publisher on Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, etc, more businesses are starting to realize as well that, conversation that happens in the comments of a Instagram photo, or people tagging each other, or things like that, is often what drives a lot of value. Now, it is a conversation. It is social. But, you are not going to build the next big thing, purely on someone else's domain. You need to have your own domain. -- Matt Mullenweg.

> It's almost like 500 years ago, everyone in the world have their own printing press and could publish as much as they want. That is the opportunity that we have today. -- Matt Mullenweg.
