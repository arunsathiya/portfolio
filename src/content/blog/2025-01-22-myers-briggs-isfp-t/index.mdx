Having taken my test originally in 2018, I recently re-took the Myers-Briggs personality test. The results identified me as an ISFP-T, also known as "The Adventurer." As I read through the detailed analysis, the description captured aspects of my personality that I've observed but never quite articulated.

The test revealed some interesting patterns about how I interact with the world. I'm strongly introverted (82%), which explains my need for personal space and time to recharge.

The results also showed high scores in both Feeling (69%) and Prospecting (69%), reflecting my tendency to approach decisions with both emotional awareness and flexibility.

I think it resonated well with me that the description of ISFPs is practical creators who value authenticity. My responses showed a strong preference for hands-on learning and creative problem-solving, rather than abstract theorizing. This aligns well with how I approach my work and personal projects – I tend to dive in and figure things out through direct experience rather than extensive planning.

The turbulent (-T) aspect of my personality (93%) was a bit surprising but enlightening. It explains my tendency to question and reflect deeply on decisions, even after they're made. While this can often leads to overthinking, it also drives my continuous desire for improvement and growth.

Looking at the career insights, it's interesting to see how my personality type thrives in environments that balance creativity with practical application. The test suggests that ISFPs often struggle with rigid structures while excelling in roles that offer flexibility and autonomy – something that strongly reflects my own professional experiences.

As I continue to process these insights, I'm particularly drawn to working on the areas highlighted as potential growth opportunities: expressing feelings more openly and developing longer-term planning skills. While personality tests aren't definitive blueprints, they can serve as valuable tools for self-reflection and understanding.
