I have an exciting news to share today.

I am joining Automattic as a Happiness Engineer. Automattic is the company behind [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/), [Jetpack](http://jetpack.com/), [WooCommerce](http://woocommerce.com/) and [many other tools that you use every day](https://automattic.com/). As a Happiness Engineer, I will responsible for creating happy, passionate and loyal customers.

Without doubt, this is a role that I have been looking forward to, for many months now. This is an exciting journey and I couldn't be more proud of having come so far.

I am grateful for all my colleagues at Automattic, at Freshworks, and my parents, for having been supportive of this all along. Thank you for being there!
