I’m currently at Srivilliputhur Andal Temple's gopuram (temple tower), which is featured in the Tamil Nadu government logo/state emblem. This is an iconic 11-storey Rajagopuram of the Srivilliputhur Andal Temple, dedicated to Andal, one of the 12 Alvar saints of South India who was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu.


The logo shows this temple tower along with the Ashoka emblem at the top and the state's name in Tamil and English. The Srivilliputhur gopuram was chosen for the state emblem as it's considered one of the finest examples of Dravidian architecture and holds great cultural and religious significance in Tamil Nadu.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
