Update:Â I have switched to using Gazette theme for my WordPress.com blog. Like Aditya mentioned in the comments, P2 theme is not meant for personal blogging.


I have always heard great news about WordPress P2's theme being popular and used hugely by the folks at Automattic. This was back in my childhood days.


I am devoted to WordPress more than ever now - got a personal WordPress.com plan yesterday and I am writing down everything here.


Enabled P2 theme on this blog a few minutes back for fast-blogging. Let's see how this goes.
