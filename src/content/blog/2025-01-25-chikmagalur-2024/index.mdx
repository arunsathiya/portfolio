I visited Chikmagalur in Karnataka this day last month with family. The weather in Karnataka was a pleasant change from Madurai weather, and we visited the Mullayanagiri peak, went jeep trekking in Bhadra wildlife sanctuary, a few other places, and a water park on the way back. 

[Banana boat ride](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=banana%20boat%20ride) at the park ended up in an accident with me and others falling off the boat midway. We were eventually rescued but for a short moment when I fell first and the boat continued to move, I felt like [Aquaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_(film)).
