Why am I just discovering the [Hosting Command Palette](https://wordpress.com/support/navigate-wordpress-com-with-your-keyboard/) feature on WordPress.com? It’s a convenient feature for quick navigation across sites and settings, and is a huge UX improvement for power users like me. I used [Turbo Admin](https://turbo-admin.com/) in the past, but this native implementation on WordPress.com is nicely done. I’d love to see it land on [Core WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) one day.

It’s contextual too - for example, “Manage general settings..” would takes you to the site’s general settings page if you are already on the site dashboard, but if you are on the Dotcom dashboard ([Calypso](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso)), you’re presented with a list of sites to choose from, following which the jump to the general settings page takes place.
