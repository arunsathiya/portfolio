Not much know about it, but if you have any kind of premium account on Zoom, enable closed captions feature on Zoom settings so that everyone joining your (your account being the host) call can benefit from captions. Instructions here: [Enabling and managing closed captioning and live transcription](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Enabling-and-managing-closed-captioning-and-live-transcription).

Once that is enabled, all members on the call can optionally turn on/off captions as needed.

The feature has a neat transcription history too! If you have to step away from the call for a few minutes, and when you come back to it, you can read the history.

[I pinged Zoom](https://twitter.com/arunsathiya/status/1419963286468976641) to consider enabling it by default for all premium accounts, but they haven't responded just yet. There's no reason not to enable it, as the functionality itself has to be activated during the call, and everyone should, for an accessible experience for everyone.
