[Apple announced encrypted DNS (DOH and DOT) for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10047/)! This is by far my most favorite announcement at WWDC 2020.

Right now, [my DNS provider](https://www.arun.blog/post/my-dns-setup/), NextDNS app for iOS, implements their feature as a VPN tunnel, which makes it impossible to use another commercial VPN like NordVPN/Mullvad at the same time.

A similar limitation applies to Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 app.

However, with the new encrypted DNS model that Apple is announcing, it looks like NextDNS can be used in conjunction with the other active VPN tunnels:

> Their approach is great, covers all bases.

    Someone like Firefox can ship a build that uses their CloudFlare partnership.

    Someone like CloudFlare can ship an app the makes the entire system use their service.

    IT departments can allow their internal domains to work.

I have reached out to the NextDNS developers to hear their thoughts. Future looks exciting for iOS!
