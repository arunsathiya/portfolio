Last week, I binge-watched "The Rain" and I can say I am looking forward to the second season already. I am not a big fan of apocalyptic movies, but this one was good. This one might probably be the first one that I have watched through the end.

The Rain is all about a brother and sister, along with a bunch of other survivors, fighting their way through the mess in a post-apocalyptic world. The story's gripping and moves fast, covering a lot of new scenes and keeps the viewers hooked to their screens.

It's a Danish thriller, based in the city of Vordinborg. The beginning feels rushed, but the primary actors' characters seem to develop around the middle episodes. The tale portrays the story of how the lead actor, Simone, fights all dangers, to protect her younger brother from all harm. At the same time, the tale depicts how everyone is very protective of each other, throughout the story. There are parts where something doesn't make any sense at all, but I wouldn't expect anything spectacular out of a thriller, apocalyptic, or horror show.

Available on Netflix: [The Rain](https://www.netflix.com/title/80154610).

It was an interesting watch, and I would recommend watching once.
